# E-Commerce Web Application API

This is a simple E-Commerce API built with Django Rest Framework. The API supports CRUD operations for products, orders, users, and payments.

## Features

- Manage users, products, orders, and payments.

- User authentication and profile management.
- Orders and order tracking.
- Email notifications for orders and account verification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
- Django Rest Framework
- Razorpay Python Client

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-project.git
cd ecommerce-project
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file for your environment variables:

```bash
RZP_KEY="your_razorpay_key"
RZP_SECRET="your_razorpay_secret"
```

Apply the migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## API Endpoints

Here is a list of the available API endpoints.

### Products
- **GET** `/products/`: List all products
- **POST** `/products/`: Create a new product
- **GET** `/products/{uuid}/`: Retrieve a single product by UUID
- **PUT** `/products/{uuid}/`: Update a product by UUID
- **DELETE** `/products/{uuid}/`: Delete a product by UUID

### Orders
- **GET** `/orders/`: List all orders
- **POST** `/orders/`: Create a new order
- **GET** `/orders/{uuid}/`: Retrieve a single order by UUID
- **PUT** `/orders/{uuid}/`: Update an order by UUID
- **DELETE** `/orders/{uuid}/`: Delete an order by UUID

### Users
- **GET** `/users/`: List all users
- **POST** `/users/`: Create a new user

## Testing with Postman

Use Postman to test the API endpoints. Here's an example of how to configure requests in Postman:

### Get All Products

- **Method**: GET
- **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/`

### Create a Product

- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/`
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Product 1",
    "category": "Electronics",
    "price": 999,
    "description": "A sample product."
  }
  ```

Continue this pattern for other endpoints as described in the "API Endpoints" section.
